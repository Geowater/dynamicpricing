\textcolor{red}{TODO: zu viel "prices", "price", "pricing"}\\
E-commerce grows faster and faster, especially in the last decade. Sometimes, hundreds of sellers vend the same product, but for a different price. Almost any sales activity, like restocking or pricing, is done by computers. This can lead price wars resulting in extraordinary low or extremely high prices. Thus, finding an appropriate price for a product and gaining as much profit as possible becomes more difficult. In this paper, we present our dynamic pricing algorithm, we developed in the last semester for the dynamic pricing seminar at HPI. It calculates prices for a current market situation in order to maximize the profit and the chance to sell a product. With our approach, setting ``wrong'' prices is a thing of the past.
