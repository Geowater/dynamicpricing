\section{Conclusion}

We discovered that the training data is very important for calculating accurate predictions. Since the merchants only receive their own sale events it does not suffice to set the best price. Sometimes it is more helpful to set experimental prices in favor to generate better training data. Finding a good balance between good prices and good training data can be challenging.

Upper and lower limits for prices are necessary to prevent extreme prices. It also appeared that investing much time into feature developing pays off.

Overall, we built a good basis for a merchant. With some effort for creating additional rules and testing particular simulations the merchant can be further enhanced (see section \ref{sec:future_work}).

Machine learning is increasingly present in many areas. On the one hand, it makes working with large data sets much easier. On the other hand, it can become complex to retrace predictions. Therefore, the importance of planning an algorithm sufficiently is high. To support the machine learning algorithm with handwritten rules helps a lot as well.
