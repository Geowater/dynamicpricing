\subsection{Universal model}
	In addition to our models for each specific product, we introduced a universal model to handle requests for new products we have never sold before. This universal model uses the features \ref{sec:pricerank} to \ref{sec:pricediff3}. These features are independent from the specific product properties, such as ranks, amount of offers or relative price differences (on a scale with the cheapest price being 0\% and the most expensive price being 100\%, where is our price located?).

	This model makes sense since it offers a more precise prediction of a good new price. Compared to other approaches for those situations (such as random prices, average prices over all products, ...), it respects typical consumer decisions without detailed information about the concrete behaviour when buying this product. But being on a specific price rank w. r. t. quality or shipping time can be a good approach anyway, at least better than a randomly chosen price.
